/** This README file contains important submission 
*   instructions for practice exercises. Please read
*   and follow the instructions below to name and 
*   organize your folders. Folders that do not conform
*   may not work. Once you understand this procedure, 
*   you can safely delete README.txt.
**/

/**  TL/DR; To summarize: 
*		1. download
*		2. unzip
*		3. edit, design, practice
*		4. save and rename
*		5. re-zip
*		6. upload
**/

/**  Naming convention: As soon as you download the 
*	 folder, you need to unzip or uncompress it. Once 
*	 it has been unzipped, you can edit and rename it. Name 
*	 the file your actual NetID. For example, my folder 
*	 would be named, simply: /tballard/.
*
*    To submit using asw.iastate.edu: Follow the instructions at
*	 https://www.it.iastate.edu/howtos/sftp. You will need to
*	 use some kind of SFTP client to upload your files. Your
*	 website will exist at yournetid.public.iastate.edu.
*
*    To submit on Moodle: Once you've completed editing your page,
*	 you need to zip or compress the edited folder again. Only 
*	 after you've recompressed it can you submit it to Moodle.

/**
*    The contents of this folder:
*
*     1. index.html - this is the webpage you will edit.
*     It needs to be in the top-level of the folder, and
*     must be named index.html.
*
*     2. style.css - this is the css sheet you will apply, 
*     when needed. Do not change its name or location.
*
*     3. assets folders - folders containing supporting files 
*     you may need for the webpage to work, such as images,
*     additional CSS, and JavaScript. You should have 3 assets
*     folders inside the main one: /css/, /img/, and /js/.
*     If you change this structure, you will need to make sure
*     your file paths are correct.
**/

/**  General rules for naming: always avoid spaces, capital 
*	letters, and non-alphanumeric characters in files you
*	intend to serve over the web. The more simply you name
*	files and folders, the easier it will be to retype them
*	when you want to call them in a page. FYI: Do *not* 
*	attempt to "change" an image file format by changing the
*	file extension (for example .jpg to .png), unless you *also*
*	correct this in your code.
